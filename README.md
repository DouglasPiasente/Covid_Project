# Covid Project

This project was created using two excel files which are [Covid Deaths](https://github.com/DouglasPiasente/Covid_Project/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx) and [Covid Vaccination](https://github.com/DouglasPiasente/Covid_Project/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx). All the information was taken from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).

The SQL code is responsible for joining both tables in a relevant way, explore and clean the data, which was necessary for the development of a Tableau visualization that you can check out in my [Tableau Public page](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/douglas.ribeiro.piasente/viz/SimpleCovidDashboard_16476312415490/CovidDashboard)
